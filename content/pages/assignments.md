Each week one or two questions will be distributed with the papers. Brief answers to the questions should be emailed to the instructor by the evening prior to discussion of the papers. To pass the class, students are expected to attend class, demonstrate fluency in the course material, submit answers to the guiding questions (listed in the table below), and complete the assignments (described in the table below):

As an assignment, you will have to find a paper that builds on the research described in this week's papers to answer a question you find interesting. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 8 | Field trip |  |
| 9 | NMDA receptors and place cells | {{< h 3 >}}Questions due by this session{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} — Tsien, et al. – How are NMDA receptors eliminated only in CA1 region of the hippocampus? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} — McHugh, et al. – What does NMDA receptor dependent plasticity in CA1 contribute to place field representation? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 10 | Hippocampal representation of space in contextual fear conditioning | {{< h 3 >}}Questions due by this session{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} — Wiltgen, et al. – What does the hippocampus contribute to contextual fear learning? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} — Miota, et al. – What is the "trade off" that is necessary when using place cell analysis to study fear memory? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 11 | Synaptic tagging | {{< h 3 >}}Questions due by this session{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} — Sajikumar, et al. – How would you test if a compound inhibits LTP induction or maintenance? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} — Kauderer, and Kandel – What stimulation protocol is sufficient for setting an LTD 'Tag'? {{< br >}}{{< br >}} {{< h 3 >}}Assignment due after this session{{< /h >}} {{< br >}}{{< br >}} — Short essay designing an experiment aimed at answering a specific question in the literature: The papers for Ses #10 present a theoretical framework called 'synaptic tagging' which was created for understanding molecular events underlying memory. One of the issues addressed by 'tagging' is: How does the molecular signal being amplified in the nucleus know which synapse to go back to? Students will be asked to design an experiment that can test a hypothesis for answering this question. The experimental design should include a description of the student's theory and the way to test it with an emphasis on relevant control experiments. The assignment should be 1–3 pages long. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
